To run HD or LW RP versions please visit HDLWRPURP Support  Packs folder and check readme files.

After you import this pack please:

- change quality level to ultra
- change shadow distance to higher in quality settings at least like 120 or 150
- change color space at player settings to linear as we setup pack to linear rendering
- if fps is avarage you could reduce LOD BIAS to 1.5 or 1 in most cases it will help alot for lower end devices.

Wind Setting 

Just put WindController.cs from Script catalog to Scene.
